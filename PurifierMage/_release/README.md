## Purifier Mage

The main purpose of this mod was to create a more support/healing forward skill tree for use during co-op play, if you have any questions/feedback please find me in the Outward Mod Discord. Hope you enjoy!

**NEW SIGIL INTERACTIONS:**

Using the following skills in conjunction with the Sigil of Life will have the aforementioned effects.

* Spark + Sigil of Life = Spark of Life: Heals the caster for 20hp instanstly 
* Reveal Soul + Sigil of Life = Gift of the Soul: Bestows mana on your allies at the cost of your own. 
* Mana Push + Sigil of Life = Second Wind: Bestows stamina on your allies at the cost of your own. 
* Mana Ward + Sigil of Life = Rejuvenation: Release rejuvenating energy into the world around you. You and your allies recover hp over time for a brief period. 
* Cleanse + Sigil of Life = Group Cleanse: Removes the requirement for the caster to have 50%+ corruption, removes 300 corruption from caster and nearby allies. You must still deal with the negative effects and it still requires a mana stone.

Using skills in conjunction with the Sigil of Life will have the aforementioned effects.
